# KIBA

Specifications
KIBA has an interface with a questionnaire, a juice mixing pump (medical equipment), LED lights and runs on Raspberry Pi. 

What is KIBA for?
We built the KIBA machine for the re:publica 2018 conference. This year's topic is POP as well as research on automation and work life, so we popped an interactive installation which combines artistic expression with scientific data. 

The name works better in German though. KIBA means "KÃ¼nstliche-Intelligenz-Berufs-Agentur", which is both an Artificial-Intelligence-Job-Agency as well as a mix drink of cherry and banana juic (KIrsche und BAnane). So you get the somewhat silly idea of a machine that helps you to cope with your automated future.
